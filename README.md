# Criminal-Record-PDF-to-SQL-Query-Parser
Project for client during freelance. Automated transformation of pdf criminal records to SQL queries

The only file in this repository is the Python file which takes in a pdf as an argument in the command prompt. The pdf must follow the specific format of the criminal records my client used. The pdf is then parsed for specific identifying information of the criminal, including different offenses and court trials, and then all of this informatino is converted to SQL queries so that my client could simply copy and paste it into their organization's database. This significantly improved the efficiency of, in their words, the mundane part of their job.

No criminal record information was shared with me in this project, only example files of the correct format were given to me. Unfortunately, my client did not give me permission to share the example files, only the written code.
